Penn State Behrend Senior Design Capstone Project:
-Server folder contains files to start local host server
-This server is run by starting simple_httpd.py
-Open the WebApp file --> Test --> run simple_httpd.py
-Go to your favorite internet browser and type in localhost:8080
-Webapp should appear on the page and it is self explanatory from there

In order for the webapp to properly run, NBA game files in JSON format are needed
-These are not provided since they are subject to copyright
-Once these files are found, they can be added to WebApp --> Test --> GameFiles
-If done properly, every game file loaded should display in the webapp
